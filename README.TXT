Project: clock-display
Authors: David Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class ClockDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the object inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as timeTick and setTime. Watch the 
"displayString" in the inspector.

The displayString field simulates the actual clock display device. Were this 
program running in a real clock, it would change the real, physical display 
hardware instead of this string. The timeTick method would be triggered once 
every minute by some timer hardware.

Everything else could be pretty much the same.


Note: This project does not implement adequate handling of errors.


Questions:

21.The time starts at 00:01 because thethe initial time was never set and the clock only starts 
   once the program is ran
22.Whether I do anything the time stayed the same 00:01
23.We would need to call it 60 times because one hour is equal to 60 minutes
24.NumberDisplay digit;
   digit = new NumberDisplay(10);
25.Rectamgle window;
   window = new Rectangle(x,y);
26.The constroctor has 2 paramters which are hours and minutes. It creates the hours and minute display
*The question after this were done after the due date with some help.
27. Both of them create objects but, 
28.public void print(String filename, boolean doubleSided)
   public int getStatus(int delay)
   p1.print("lab_3.pdf", true);
   p1.print("README.txt", false);
   int status = p1.getStatus(5);
   p1.getStatus(0);
29.The picture constructor creates a square, a triangle and a circle
30.roof.changeSize(150);
   roof.changeColor("black");
   roof.makeVisible();
   roof.moveHorizontal(50);
   roof.moveVertical(200);
31.No it does not contian any method calls
32.8 divided by 3 is 2
33.When the first or both numbers are negative the answer is negative
34.ALl possibilities are from the range of 0 to 4
35.???
36-37.I was not able to complete the challenge
